# TODO to get this working
- make a run script to copy all the files to where they need to be
- need to be able to pick betweeen i3 and hyprland


- all so in env is essentially a copy of the files in the home directory
    - with .config etc


# TODO - put this in a consistent place that makes sense!
- currently in the .zshrc
    export PATH="$HOME/personal/repos/tmux-sessionizer:$PATH"
